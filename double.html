     <h1>Double Action Revolvers</h1>
     <p>Double action revolvers are the second type of revolvers. They were made near the end of the wild west time period. They are much faster and more convenient than single action revolvers. This is because unlike single action revolvers, you don’t have to pull the hammer back to shoot it. When you pull the trigger, the hammer goes back on it’s own and slams forward into the firing pin, which causes an explosion that sends the bullet out. While you don’t have to pull the hammer back before you shoot, you can and it will make it easier to pull the trigger. When you pull the trigger, it also rotates the cylinder to the next bullet. To reload a double action, you just press a button on the side and the whole cylinder pops out. You can then dump out the empty bullet casings and put in new bullets. Then, the cylinder easily pops back into the gun. Double action revolvers are very easy to use and are still used a lot today.</p>
