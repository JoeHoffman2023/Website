     <h1>Semi Automatic Pistols</h1>
     <p>Semi auto pistols are the newest and most popular type of pistol. They are really easy and can hold more than most revolvers. They were first made towards the end of the 1800s. Unlike revolvers, they don’t have cylinders. Instead of cylinders, you put a magazine full of bullets into the bottom of the gun. For some older semi autos, you put the bullets into the top of the gun without a magazine, but pistols like that aren’t really made anymore. At the top of the pistol there is a part called the slide. When you put the magazine in, you have to pull the slide back and release it back by pressing a button on the side of the gun. This takes the bullet at the top of the magazine and puts it into the gun. This will also push the hammer back so that you can shoot the gun.  Like single action revolvers, you can’t shoot it if the hammer isn’t back. When you pull the trigger, the hammer goes forward and hits the firing pin, which sends the bullet through the barrel and out of the gun. The explosion of the bullet causes the slide to go back. When the slide goes back, the hammer is pushed back again, the bullet casing gets pushed through a hole at the top of the gun, and a new bullet is taken from the magazine and put into the gun. When you shoot the last bullet in the magazine, the slide will stay back. To reload it, you press a button that ejects the magazine and put a full one in. Then, you press a button that sends the slide back forward and it is ready to shoot. Another thing that semi autos have is a safety switch. If the switch is on, you can’t shoot the gun. Semi autos are the easiest and most convenient pistols to use, and have been used for over a hundred years.</p>
