     <h1>Single Action Revolvers</h1>
     <p>Single action revolvers were the first revolvers and were heavily used during the days of the wild west. They were hard to use because they took a long time to shoot and reload. To shoot the gun, you have to pull the hammer back before pulling the trigger. When you pull the trigger, the hammer goes forward and hits the firing pin. The firing pin hits the back of the bullet, which causes an explosion that sends the bullet out of the gun. When you want to fire the next bullet, you have to pull the hammer back again. Every time you pull the hammer back, it rotates the cylinder. The cylinder is the part in the middle of the gun that holds the bullets. When the cylinder rotates it puts the next bullet in front of the firing pin. When you fire the gun, the top part of the bullet leaves the gun through the barrel(the long part in the front of the gun), but the bullet casing stays in the cylinder. For some single actions, you can flip the cylinder out of the gun to pull the casings out and put new bullets in, but for most single actions it is way harder. When you want to reload these guns, you have to first pull the hammer back halfway. After you do this, you push down on a long rod that is under the barrel. This will push the casing out of one hole in the cylinder. Then, you can put a new bullet in that hole and rotate the cylinder to the next hole. You have to do this with all six holes in the cylinder. This is why single action revolvers were harder to use, and when double action revolvers came out, people started using those a lot more.</p>
